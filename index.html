    Presenting your work is a pivotal moment in the process of design. This is where your approach can either make or break your work. Whether you’re presenting to clients, stakeholders, or your boss, you need to plan out exactly how you will express your design to your audience in order to sell it to them. Jonathan Cofer, the Creative Director of Upwork, suggests a handful of key points to hit. The first is to make your presentation polished, showing it in the best possible light. Eliminate distractions, use a clean and organized template, zero in on a single focus point in each slide, and practice your presentation a couple times beforehand. Next, Cofer says it’s important to set context. This will keep your presentation focused on what really matters. Clear communication throughout your slides is key. Cofer then suggests you should include the story of how your design was created. Talk about any inspirations to show your thought process. Controlling the pace of your presentation is just as important too. Be sure not to rush while presenting, but monitor your audience to know when to speed things up. Keep an eye on the time, and have any questions be asked once you’re done. The next step is to guide feedback. Let your audience know what you’re looking for and what you’re not looking for. If you disagree, make it known, respectfully. However, their insights could end up helping your overall design. Ultimately, be confident in your design, and others will be too. 
    Another skill that all designers should have is to know how to critique and give balanced feedback. How you offer this feedback is more universal than what feedback you give. Randall Stutman says you should recognize the difference of technique and routine. Technique is used for effect, but it isn’t always universal. Since you can’t apply the same technique every time, you are prevented from mastering it. Routine involves how you give feedback. This is what you do every time, allowing you to become masterful at it. When Stutman says your feedback should be balanced, he means that your list of positives should be just as nuanced, emphasized, detailed, vivid, and elaborate as your negatives. You should have around the same number of positive and negative comments.
